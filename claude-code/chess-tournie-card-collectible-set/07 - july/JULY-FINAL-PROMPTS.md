```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series July tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Rain grey/Peacock green with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Cloud blue/Peacock green with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Rain grey/Cloud blue with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use July Monsoon colors (rain grey, cloud blue, peacock green, purple) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Monsoon featuring Krishna's flute, peacock dances, and rain celebrations. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - July 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing monsoon attire inspired by Krishna with flute, peacock feather crown, rain-soaked blue robes, holding an umbrella shaped like lotus.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, decorated with rain drops, peacock motifs, and cloud patterns
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "JULY" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "JUL-001"

I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing monsoon dancer attire with rain-themed jewelry, holding lightning-shaped scepter, adorned with rain lilies.

- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with rain motifs as the King card
