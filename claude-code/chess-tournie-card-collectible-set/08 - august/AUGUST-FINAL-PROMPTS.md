I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series August tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Saffron/White/Green tricolor with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (White/Navy blue with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Green/Saffron with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use August Independence Day colors (saffron, white, green - Indian tricolor) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Indian Independence Day featuring freedom, patriotism, and national pride. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.
