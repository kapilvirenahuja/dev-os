I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series April tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Fresh green/Blossom pink with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Sky blue/Blossom pink with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Fresh green/Sky blue with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use April Spring colors (fresh green, blossom pink, sky blue) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Spring renewal featuring Baisakhi harvest, Ram Navami, and Ugadi new year celebrations. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character.

The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing elegant spring festival saree with floral patterns, jasmine and rose garlands, holding a lotus bloom and Ugadi pachadi bowl.
