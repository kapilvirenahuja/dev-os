```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series November tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Festival gold/Lamp yellow with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Firework colors/Festival gold with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Lamp yellow/Firework colors with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use November Diwali colors (festival gold, lamp yellow, bright firework colors - orange, pink, green, blue) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Diwali - Festival of Lights, featuring prosperity, illumination, and celebration. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - November 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing royal Diwali attire with golden sherwani, holding a golden diya lamp, adorned with marigold garlands, blessed by Goddess Lakshmi.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, illuminated with diya lamp designs and sparkles
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "NOVEMBER" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "NOV-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Light's Triumph"

```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing elegant Diwali saree with golden border, holding sparklers, adorned with jewelry, standing near rangoli.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with diya patterns as the King card
