```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series March tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Vibrant rainbow spectrum with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Rainbow colors with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Full color spectrum with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use March Holi festival colors (full rainbow spectrum - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is the Festival of Colors with Krishna playing Holi. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - March 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing traditional Indian kurta completely covered in vibrant Holi colors and gulal powder, inspired by Krishna playing Holi.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, splattered with rainbow colors
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "MARCH" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "MAR-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Color Blast Checkmate"
- Bottom text: "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series - Premium Edition"

### ü•à IMAGE 2 - March 2nd Place - RANI (Queen) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing elegant Indian lehenga splashed with multiple Holi colors, holding color-filled balloons.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with color splatters as the King card

- Color palette: Rainbow spectrum with emphasis on pink, purple, blue, green, yellow with subtle silver accents for 2nd place

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a third collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS BISHOP PIECE as the main character. The bishop piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive mitre top, but given human-like qualities wearing traditional dhoti-kurta drenched in Holi colors, holding a plate of colored gulal powders.

Design elements (matching the style of the first two cards):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with multicolor splashes as the previous cards
