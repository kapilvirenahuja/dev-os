```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series February tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Rose pink/Deep red with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Romantic purple/Rose pink with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Deep red/Romantic purple with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use February Valentine colors (rose pink, deep red, romantic purple) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme combines Valentine's Day with Radha-Krishna love stories. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - February 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing romantic Indian royal attire with heart motifs and rose garlands, inspired by Lord Krishna.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares and subtle heart shapes
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "FEBRUARY" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "FEB-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Love's Checkmate"
- Bottom text: "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series - Premium Edition"

### ü•à IMAGE 2 - February 2nd Place - RANI (Queen) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing elegant Indian sari with heart patterns and jasmine flowers, inspired by Radha.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares and heart motifs as the King card

I need a third collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS BISHOP PIECE as the main character. The bishop piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive mitre top, but given human-like qualities wearing traditional Indian wedding priest attire with heart embroidery and holding a ceremonial staff with roses.
