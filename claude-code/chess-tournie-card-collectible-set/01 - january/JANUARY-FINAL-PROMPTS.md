```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series January tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Ice blue/Kashmir purple with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Snow white/Ice blue with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Kashmir purple/Snow white with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use January winter colors (ice blue, snow white, Kashmir purple) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - January 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing ornate Kashmiri royal winter attire including traditional patterns and a regal cape.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "JANUARY" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "JAN-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Winter's Gambit"

### ü•à IMAGE 2 - January 2nd Place - RANI (Queen) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing an elegant Kashmiri pashmina shawl with winter patterns and silver jewelry.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares as the King card

I need a third collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS BISHOP PIECE as the main character. The bishop piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive mitre top, but given human-like qualities wearing traditional winter robes with Kashmir embroidery and holding a ceremonial staff.
