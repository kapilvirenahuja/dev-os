I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series September tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Harvest gold/Burnt orange with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Brown/Harvest gold with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Burnt orange/Brown with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use September Autumn colors (harvest gold, burnt orange, brown) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Autumn harvest featuring Ganesh Chaturthi and seasonal transition. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing autumn harvest saree with grain patterns, marigold and autumn leaf garlands, holding harvest basket.
