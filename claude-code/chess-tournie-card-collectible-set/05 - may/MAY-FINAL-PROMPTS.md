I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series May tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Mustard yellow/Royal blue with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Desert sand/Mustard yellow with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Royal blue/Desert sand with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use May North India colors (mustard yellow, royal blue, desert sand) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is North India featuring Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, and the Himalayas. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - May 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing Punjab Maharaja attire with golden turban, bhangra costume elements, holding a khanda (double-edged sword), with Golden Temple inspiration.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, decorated with wheat stalks, dhol drums, and phulkari embroidery patterns
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "MAY" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "MAY-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Punjab's Pride"
- Bottom text: "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series - Premium Edition"
- Background: Golden wheat fields of Punjab, Golden Temple architecture, mustard fields in bloom, bhangra dancers, chess pieces as farmers

### ü•à IMAGE 2 - May 2nd Place - RANI (Queen) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing Rajasthani royal attire with ghoonghat, traditional jewelry, mirror work lehenga, holding a decorated hand fan.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with Rajasthani motifs as the King card

I need a third collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS BISHOP PIECE as the main character. The bishop piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive mitre top, but given human-like qualities wearing Himalayan monk robes with Delhi's India Gate influence, holding prayer wheel and ceremonial staff.
