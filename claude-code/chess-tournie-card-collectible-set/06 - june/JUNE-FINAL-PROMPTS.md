I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series June tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Sun yellow/Cool blue with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Mango orange/Mint green with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Cool blue/Sun yellow with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use June Hot Summer colors (sun yellow, cool blue, mango orange, mint green) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Indian summer with cooling elements, mangoes, and traditional summer relief. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - June 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing light cotton kurta, holding a traditional hand fan and brass lassi glass, crown decorated with mango leaves.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, decorated with mango motifs, kulfi designs, and cooling elements
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "JUNE" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "JUN-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Summer Solstice Strike"

```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing light summer saree with floral prints, holding decorated matka (clay pot) and peacock feather fan, jasmine gajra in hair.

- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with summer motifs as the King card
