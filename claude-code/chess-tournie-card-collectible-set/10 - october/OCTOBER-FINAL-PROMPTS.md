```
I need you to generate THREE SEPARATE collectible trading card images for a chess tournament using DALL-E 3. Each card should be generated as its own individual image. These are for the Shatranj Samrat Championship Series October tournament winners.

Please generate these three cards as SEPARATE IMAGES:
1. First Place - King (Victory red/Divine gold with gold accents for rank)
2. Second Place - Queen (Royal purple/Divine gold with silver accents for rank)
3. Third Place - Bishop (Victory red/Royal purple with bronze accents for rank)

All cards should use October Dussehra colors (victory red, divine gold, royal purple) with metallic accents to distinguish ranks. The theme is Dussehra - victory of good over evil, featuring Lord Ram's triumph over Ravana. I'll provide the detailed prompts for each card below.

## ChatGPT DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompts

**IMPORTANT:** Please generate THREE SEPARATE IMAGES, one for each place (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Do not combine them into a single image.

### ü•á IMAGE 1 - October 1st Place - RAJA (King) Card

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a collectible trading card design for a chess tournament. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS KING PIECE as the main character. The king piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing Lord Ram's warrior attire with divine bow (Dhanush), arrows, and royal armor in victory pose.

Design elements:
- Border: Ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares, decorated with arrows and divine weapons
- Top left: Text reading "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series"
- Top right: "OCTOBER" badge
- Top center: Prominent gold-accented banner with "RAJA - 1ST PLACE"
- Bottom right corner: "OCT-001"
- Bottom stats box showing: "Attack: 95 | Defense: 90 | Strategy: 100 | Special: Divine Victory"
- Bottom text: "Shatranj Samrat Championship Series - Premium Edition"

**Prompt for DALL-E 3:**
```
I need a second collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS QUEEN PIECE as the main character. The queen piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive crown, but given human-like qualities wearing Goddess Durga's warrior attire with trident (trishul), divine weapons, and victory garland.

Design elements (matching the style of the first card):
- Border: Same ornate Indian mandala patterns mixed with chess board squares with weapon motifs as the King card

I need a third collectible trading card for the same chess tournament series. Create a premium trading card (2.5" x 3.5" ratio) featuring an anthropomorphized CHESS BISHOP PIECE as the main character. The bishop piece should be clearly recognizable as a chess piece with its distinctive mitre top, but given human-like qualities wearing sage warrior robes with sacred mace (gada), holding victory torch and dharma scroll.
